- moss/umbross-like game:
- arcade game where you have to beat 5-10 levels at record time
- one standard block class that takes care of all blocks
- either "handdrawn" graphics or a nice background with black blocks
- if time is left, add goodies, skillful shortcuts etc. to the game

- verdict: easy, simple programming, one song (or no songs), only few art files
