- ptcpt. b's pet project

- basically a TLOZ-like game
- you should be able to save at ANY point and continue at any time (write all relevant info in a file)
- time paradox: travel back in time to kill baddie
- at the end of a dungeon you would get a "power X", using the power from the future! (but it sounds nice right)
- definitely sword, perhaps shield, maybe bow and arrow etc.
i handguuuun pleeeease :(
- maybe two characters: one who uses weapons (see above) and one who manipulates environments/lakes/etc.
i theme: water (walk across, manipulate rivers and seas, 3states of water)
  -> (spilled) water acting like SM64 paintings)
i alternatively, the theme could be an uninhabited village (too much apocalypse?) or toys.
  -> it would be fun to see a lowres game be colourful and jovial and shit
  -> "real animals" also sounds like a ludicrous theme
- time period: middle ages
i choice system: e.g. beach vs. mountain cave entry to dungeon, with small differences
i lots of climates in small hub world -> animalcrossing-like

- verdict: very hard: multiple dungeons, weapons, songs, enemies, tons of sprites etc.
duwolltestesso!
