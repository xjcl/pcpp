- ptcpt. a's pet project

- a game where you run automatically from left to right and have ~4 powers to manipulate the environment
- a collision means death
- i'd say "reminiscent of bit.trip runner" if i had played former game

- ability ideas:
- flood: ON: lifts you lightly over time, OFF: you fall according to gravity
- (low) gravity: similar to flood, just slower/no fall instead of lift
- magnet: +: repels objects, enemies and goodies, -: attracts them
- smash: can be used 2 times in a level. smashes through opponents and (soft) obstacles w/o gravity
- burn: burns the whole screen until turned off -> egg-scrambling mini-game! jk
  -> use in ice/water/vapor puzzles (maybe too complex for small screen?)
- mirror screen. axis at width/2
  
- verdict: medium, depends on the types of abilities (rotation of abilities?) and number of levels programmed.
