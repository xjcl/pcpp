- least worked-out concept
- we don't know anything about shooters but they look easy to program ok
- maybe look at resogun/herzog2
- participant a would like a big 2000x2000px map with turns via loopings and stuff
- ptcpt. b is in favour of a more resogun-like game

- verdict: medium-hard, result meh, once again, not a very developed idea (yet)
