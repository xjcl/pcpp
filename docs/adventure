- ptcpt. b's pet project

- basically a TLOZ-like game
- time period: middle ages
- title ideas: THE QUEST OF SPIARMF; THE QUEST THAT LASTED 5EVER (because 5 climates getitgetit)
- you should be able to save at ANY point and continue at any time (write all relevant info in a file)
- time paradox: travel back in time to kill baddie
- at the end of a dungeon you would get a "power X", using the power from the future! (but it sounds nice right)
- definitely sword, perhaps shield, maybe bow and arrow etc.
- rather have "powers" than weapons to mix things up
- in any case it is important to have 3 types of bushes: invincible, vincible w/ big sword, vincible
- maybe two characters: one who uses weapons (see above) and one who manipulates environments/lakes/etc.
  theme: water (walk across, manipulate rivers and seas, 3states of water)
  -> (spilled) water acting like SM64 paintings)
  -> either manipulating is possible into predetermined paths or "freely" -> elevation level per tile
  -> option 1: maybe have multiple riverbeds to choose from with one as the minimum
  -> waterdar: bar that fills the closer you get to a (hidden?) body of water
  -> paths can open up in the ocean/you get an ability to float over water at some point
      or to part it - but there are different kinds of water (mountain, pest/sewer, lava?)
  -> forest/city cave: messiah ability to remove collisions with water -> cross over to ice world
  -> better: local water drain that works on 4x4, excludin rims
  -> prior to that: one-time ability to build a bridge (either to dungeon or other area)?
  -> skills[n] = {false, false, false, false}; if skills[0] {sth.}
i alternatively, the theme could be an uninhabited village (too much apocalypse?) or toys.
  -> it would be fun to see a lowres game be colourful and jovial and shit
  -> one can bring in some uninhabited houses to search regardless
  -> "real animals" also sounds like a ludicrous theme
i the events in the game could mirror historical events/disasters: great fire of london
  choice system: e.g. beach vs. mountain cave entry to dungeon, with small differences
i lots of climates in small hub world -> animalcrossing-like


ACTUALLY:
- now that programming and mapping has started it looks like it's more of a closed- than an open-world adventure
  -> maybe we can change that by having both forest/city and beach area open at the same time
- dialogue will be the whole screen in black upon entering a new screen and dependent upon skills[n]
  -> should cover the whole screen with a tiny font and be in a separate loop. stopped by any button.
  -> should be realistic (i can dream!) and have some meaning, but mostly serve as guide and help
  (little girl at central lake) "..." - "SOMETHING UP?" - "NOTHING. I JUST WANTED TO REST AT THIS LAKE" - "OH WELL THEN. GO ON." - "HEY, WHAT ARE YOU SITTING ON?" - "IT'S A BIG WHITISH THING MY DAD FISHED OUT OF THE RIVER. MOM THINKS IT COMES FROM SOMETHING ALIVE, BUT THERE IS NOTHING THIS BIG AROUND HERE..."
  -> more realistic: occasional slipups that reveal you are from the future and useless NPCs
  -> ok... what? this will never be possible. better keep it funny (middle ages: "THAT SEEMS LIKE A PEST" - "WHAT'S A PEST?"; renaissance: "THIS GINORMOUS THING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LAKE LOOKED AN AWFUL LOT LIKE A VERTEBRA. BUT THERE ARE NO ANIMALS THIS BIG AROUND. I CONCLUDE, THIS IS GOD'S BONE!")
  -> don't keep a fascist gouvernment in if you don't have to fight it!
  -> ALSO: find a good motivation for such a perilous journey or text below:
  -> OK HERE IS A GOOD ONE: no one will want to know about you and what you are doing. sadly, this is kind of implemented in tloz already. but i mean that in here, you will have NO allies at all. in the later/return dialogoues, you will question if you should at all continue / be cynic about everything you say
  -> i should be in one room "you find yourself in a small city, beach is to the east bla bla" - "your writing is bad" - "fuck you... you're right i suck... *silently weeps*"
  -> mountain region pretty railroaded, but then beach-city-forest area open?
  -> maybe since dragons: comment on china? i.e. some are super patriotic, others are cynic, but you literally have "no time" to tackle this greater problem (sth. horrible happens in end-scene?)
- status bar with hearts, mini-map (better than zelda) and two slots: mouse and "5" (numpad)
  -> "5" is action command (sword or sth. else lateron)
  -> also need to reprogram WASD as move


TODO:
- explain where sword comes from
- have story of time travel that justifies 30 min time limit
- then implement a secret way to skip a part




- verdict: very hard: multiple dungeons, weapons, songs, enemies, tons of sprites etc.
duwolltestesso!
