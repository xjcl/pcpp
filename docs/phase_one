idea:

- two guys designing games in order to acquire c++/programming skills for uni/job/fun




tools:

- find c++ compiler
- find game-making libraries (display, key press events etc.)
- version control: git
- guide: LCTHW
- license: probably GPL, since nobody would want this shit




feedback:

- the full code should be seen by everybody, especially during early phases
- anyone can add to anything, but the responsibilities are usually discussed earlier in the week
- don't scare away from prototypes, expanding on a minor idea etc. also, share your results
- "i": idea not seen by others, "-": idea deemed partly plausible by others
