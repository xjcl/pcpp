- moss/umbross-like game:
- arcade game where you have to beat 1-3 levels at record time
- one standard block class that takes care of all blocks
- either "handdrawn" graphics or a nice background with black blocks
- if time is left, add goodies, skillful shortcuts etc. to the game
- possible themes: black world, toy world, water world, quantum world, blue screen of death world
- bsodw: blue background, white tiles, flickering shadow on oss
-> change shadow on CHARacTer looking to the left, so lighting is consistent
-> flicker only if standing still? / for story at the start?
- count down instead of up -> more replay incentive because you die
- how about calling this game "(goddammit) rOSS"?

- verdict: easy, few functionalities, one song (or no songs), only few art files
